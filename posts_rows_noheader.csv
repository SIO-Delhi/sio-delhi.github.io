0dfbc47e-9591-4c5a-ada1-75caa0e6754b,media,Beyond Tokenism: Where is the ‘Muslim Question’ in JNUSU Elections?,,"<div class=""siodel-block block-text""><p>Jawaharlal Nehru University has long stood as a symbol of resistance against the majoritarian Hindutva regime. As a democratic space, JNU and the JNU Students’ Union have historically played an important role in shaping national discourses. In these tough times, when universities—especially Muslim institutions—are under systematic attack, JNU has also been a consistent target of state repression.</p><p>SIO, as a nationwide student organization, has stood with JNU in its struggles, consistently raising its voice in solidarity. As the JNUSU elections approach, we believe there are some urgent and critical questions to be posed before all political groups in JNU. These questions have emerged from the margins, from the lived experiences of Muslims, and from the increasing suffocation that surrounds their existence in this country.</p><p>Muslims in India are going through perhaps the most difficult phase in post-independence history. Since 2014, the BJP-led Hindutva government has accelerated its agenda of pushing Muslims out of public spaces—socially, politically, culturally, and economically. From the CAA–NRC to the Waqf (Amendment) Act, the state has made its intentions clear to systematically marginalize, de-legitimize, and invisibilize Muslims from the national fabric.</p><p>The Muslim question in India today is not just another case of marginalization—it is a crisis rooted in the struggle for dignity, faith, and the fundamental right to exist and dissent without fear. It goes beyond demands for representation or reservations; it is about living as a Muslim in public life without humiliation or criminalization. We urge all political groups contesting the JNUSU elections, especially the Left, Liberal, and Dalit groups, to move beyond symbolic gestures like donning a keffiyeh or offering token representation.</p><p><strong>SIO JNU</strong></p></div>",https://api.siodelhi.org/uploads/images/1769080016084-cropped-cover-1769080016084.webp,default,2025-04-19 00:00:00+00,2026-01-22 11:07:26.980653+00,,true,,false,,false,,,"[""JNUSU Elections""]",,[]
